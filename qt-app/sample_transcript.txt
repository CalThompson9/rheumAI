I'm Dr. Strange, here with Jeffery, and we're going to discuss his arthritis today. Jeffery has had rheumatoid arthritis for a couple months, first diagnosed last January 2025, presenting with swollen hands and feet. 
How have you been feeling since your last visit?
My hands have been really swollen, especially in the evenings.
Both hands?
Yeah, it starts in the late afternoon and gets worse by the evening. By nighttime, it’s hard to even hold a fork or type on my computer.
Any pain along with the swelling?
Yeah, they ache a lot, and sometimes they feel warm.
Have you noticed any numbness or tingling?
A little bit in my fingertips, but not all the time.
Are you still taking methotrexate?
Yeah, once a week.
Any side effects?
Just some nausea after I take it. It usually goes away by the next day.
That’s good to know. I’m looking at your blood work, and your CRP is slightly elevated at 1.2, CBC is normal, creatinine is normal, and ALT is within range. Any recent illnesses or infections?
No, nothing major.
Any new stressors or big life changes?
Not really, just work.
You’re still working as a software engineer?
Yeah, at a startup here in Chicago. It’s a lot of hours, but I like it.
And you’re living in the city?
Yeah, I just moved into my own apartment a few months ago.
How’s that been?
It’s nice, but I definitely miss having someone else do the dishes.
Do you live alone, or do you have roommates?
Just me, but I do have a cat.
What’s your cat’s name?
Milo.
Any new heart or lung issues?
Nope.
No chest pain or shortness of breath?
No.
Alright, let’s move on to the physical exam. Your blood pressure is 128 over 78, weight is 97 kilograms, lungs are clear on auscultation, heart sounds are normal with no murmurs, and no peripheral edema. Joint exam shows significant swelling in both hands, particularly in the MCP and PIP joints, with some tenderness on palpation. No visible deformities, but there’s clear inflammation.
My impression is that your arthritis is flaring, especially in the hands, with worsening evening swelling and some sensory symptoms. Your CRP being slightly elevated supports that. Since the methotrexate is helping somewhat but not completely, we’re going to make a few adjustments. I want you to continue with the methotrexate, but we’re also going to add hydroxychloroquine at 200 milligrams twice daily. We’ll do blood work in a month to monitor inflammation levels, and I want to see you back in three months to reassess. Let me know if the swelling worsens or if you notice any new symptoms.
